Screw_north = the longer screws that connect the top and bottom pieces

Screw_south = the shorter screws that connect the top and bottom pieces

Plate screws are M2.5 x 0.45mm thread (just like the case screws) but you should buy those with length 4mm or 6mm

Screw_weight = screws for the weight (these have a different thread and width)

you need ALL of them
